At VIX, we believe in constantly testing our limits and that means we expect our team to always be learning. We should always be on the look out for new and better ways to complete our work. New techniques, new tools and technologies. How do we make our work better, more efficient and overall more awesome?
  
Some of the questions we like to ask ourselves when we complete a task are:
- Have I completed the task to the **best of my ability**?
- Is there something I could do that would allow me to do the task **faster** or **more efficiently** next time?
- Did I use the **best tools/techniques** for the job or just the ones that I'm used to?
- Did I **fully understand** how what I did works at a technical level?

#### Personal Development Plans
Every 3 months everyone reviews and updates their own **PDP** which they then discuss with [Chris](http://vix.digital/team/christopher-shaw) to see if they need any support or training to help them reach their personal development goals and how they have progressed with the goals set last time around.
  
We all try to help each other meet our personal goals, by pairing, show and tells and brown bag sessions in which we go through something we've learnt in detail so that other people can understand it better and use that knowledge too.

#### 1-to-1s
At the beginning of each month every team member has a short call or in-person chat with [Chris](http://vix.digital/team/christopher-shaw). This chat allows Chris to give some brief feedback and gives the team member the chance to talk about how works been going over the past month, any problems they might have and let us know if there's anything they need from VIX as a company to help them in their work.
