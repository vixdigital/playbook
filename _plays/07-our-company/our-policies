Making sure that everyone is following the same rules, means we can focus on building pioneering applications and creating a great work environment.  

## Working Hours and Leave

### Working Day
Our typical working hours are 9am to 5pm Monday to Friday, we do allow for a little time for trains and traffic. Sometimes we need all hands on deck a few more hours a week and but the team are rewarded accordingly. 
### Booking and Taking Leave
The VIX holiday year is from 1 April to 31st March. We encourage our team to take all their holidays (22 days plus bank holidays), everyone needs a break right? But we do allow the team to carry over a maximum of 5 days over to the following year 
For us to keep the team running we ask that a mimnum of 4 week notice is given for any leave (some cases are exempt), and that no more than 2 team members are off at the same time. 
### Sickness
We ask our team members to inform their manager which is (Chris)[https://vix.digital/team/christopher-shaw/], before the start of the working day, when they won't be able to make it in due to sickness. Our teams health and wellbeing is our number one priority, so we are open to alterntive working until they are 100%.  

## Salaries 
Pay is reviewed each year and your contribution to the team will be reflected in this. 

## Disciplinaries 

## Grievances
At VIX we like to be transparent and open about any problems in the team and address them quickly. Although we use Slack for most of our communication, this is something we like to do in person as a team. So at the end of each week we hold a Retro 
(see more about our ceremonies here) and the team can talk about anything they are unhappy about or confused by along with things they are happy with aswell as thanking other team members for anything they have done in the week. 
Immediate problems can be address with either (Chris)[https://vix.digital/team/christopher-shaw/] or (Tony)[https://vix.digital/team/tony-yates/]

## Dress Code
We can't look swish all the time so all we ask is for smart/casual. 

## Expense Claims
Expenses are agreed at the beginning of a project, including travel and are submitted before the end of each month using our expenses form.   

## Security 
Our security policies and procedures are extensive. See [link] for a comprehensive list from our security expert. 

## Diversity 
Want to build pioneering applications? Then you're part of the team. 
We don't discrimitate against gender or ethnicity, we just want people who work hard and play hard.
