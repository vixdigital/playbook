We care about results, transparency, sharing, efficiency, collaboration, kindness, boring solutions, hobbies, cake and fun.

#### #1 Results
We care about what you achieve; the code you shipped, the user you made happy, and the team member you helped. 

Do not compete by proclaiming how many hours you worked yesterday because we don't want someone who took the afternoon off to feel like they did something wrong. 

Instead celebrate the achievements of yourself and your teammates. We want people to have the desire to ship.

#### #2 Transparency
Be open about as many things as possible. By making information public we can reduce the threshold to contribution and make collaboration easier. 

On a personal level you should tell it like it is instead of putting up a poker face. Don't be afraid to admit you made a mistake or were wrong. When something went wrong it is a great opportunity to say 'whatâ€™s the kaizen moment here' and find a better way without hurt feelings. Does the slack conversation need to be private? If not discuss it in the open.

#### #3 Sharing
We care about great software, a great team and a great environment, share, write documentation, give lessons and brown bag sessions, blog about what you did and what you learnt. We are grateful to our clients for using us and our users for their feedback.

#### #4 Efficiency
We care about working on the right things, not doing more than needed, and not duplicating work. This enables us to achieve more progress with less people and makes our work more fulfilling. 

We think of how we can make the company better instead of being territorial or defensive. Get started, work with the team to get feedback early.

#### #5 Collaboration
Helping others is a priority. You are expected to ask others for help and advice. 

Anyone can join in discussing any subject. You don't have to comply with all feedback but you should always take it seriously.

#### #6 Kindness
We do not like nasty pigs in our team. We give feedback and respect each other, we do this in a kind way, any negative feedback should be done on a one to one basis, positive feedback should always be done publicly in front of the team. 

Negative feedback should be about the work, not the person. We use our thanks channel to show appreciation to team members who went that extra mile to help us, make us feel great or just made things better.

#### #7 Boring solutions
Use the most simple and boring solution for a problem. You can always make it more complex later if that is needed. The speed of innovation for our company and products is constrained by the total complexity we add, so every little reduction in complexity helps.

Don't pick an interesting technology just to make your work more fun, using code that is popular will ensure many bugs are already solved and its familiarity makes it easier for others to contribute.

#### #8 Hobbies
Talk about them, however strange, we should all try and take part in what our colleagues do, it shows respect for each other, appreciation for the things others are good at.

#### #9 Cake
Bake a cake every now and then, everyone will love you for it and it makes everyone  smile.

#### #10 Fun
We do things the fun way, if you don't love what you do at work then it's the wrong work. Use sharpies, colour, walls, windows and doors, try to make tasks fun, get others involved. Ride your bike to work, play chess, eat lunch together, laugh.
