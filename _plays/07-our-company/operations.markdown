As a company we strive to over deliver value to our clients on every project so it can be challenging switching to work on the business side of things which are nevertheless just as important.

Improving efficiency and streamlining our companies operations is vital, and lets our talented crew get on with what they love - [building amazing applications and services](http://vix.digital/our-work).

Here's a few things we've learnt over the years:
- Focus on the Minimum Viable Product (MVP), then make it awesome
- Understand what we're good at and when to outsource
- Automate as much of the boring, repetitive things as possible
- Never underestimate seemingly benign tasks

#### Calendar
We use [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com) for both our personal and team calendars.

#### Documents
We use [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com) to create easily shareable, collaborative documents like content drafts, proposals and bids.

#### Email
We use [Google Mail](https://mail.google.com) for our emails - it's simple, works well and integrates with the rest of the tools we use.

#### Meetings
We try to get clients involved as much as possible by inviting them to observe our [Daily Standups](https://vix.digital/playbook/daily-stand-ups/) and [Show and Tells](https://vix.digital/playbook/show-tell/). This reduces the need for the standard meetings that don't provide much value for either of us.

For times when remote meetings are requireed we try to use [Google Hangouts](https://hangouts.google.com/). For some clients such as the NHS we might use [Cisco Webex](https://www.webex.co.uk/) instead as it's their conference app of choice.
