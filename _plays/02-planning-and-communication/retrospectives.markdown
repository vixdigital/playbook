Restrospectives or retros for short are a team ceremony that usually take place at the end of something - at the end of the week, the end of the month or simply the end of a sprint.

During a retro we each take turns to give our feedback on what went well during that period, what didn't go well and what we should do differently going forward. It's also an opportunity to commend people on a job well done or for going out of their way to help someone else with their task(s).

Once a list of suggestions for actions going forward are compiled, the team discusses them and decides which will be acted upon in the next week/month/sprint.

Retrospectives are one of the most important team ceremonies for agile teams - they provide the opportunity for constant, structured feedback and improvement of the way we approach our work and allow us to continually improve as individuals and as a group.
