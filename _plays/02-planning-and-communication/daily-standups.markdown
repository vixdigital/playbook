<h4> Simple yet effective </h4>

We use daily standups as a way to update the team on everyone's status. Daily standups are short and simple but effective. We each take it in turns to talk about the following.

- What we did yesterday
- What we are doing today
- Are we blocked by anything (is there anything stopping us from completing the task)

We hold our standups at 10am everyday, whether you are in the office or working remote you must attend, **stand up waits for no man!** 

We move away from our desks as this eliminates any distractions and brings everyone's focus to the team, along with allowing us to stretch our legs. Although we try to keep our standups short and sweet we often find they're a good place to start discussions around problems we need to resolve or propose new ideas. Having a daily status update allows us to make sure everyone is working towards the same goal.
