<h4>Why are show and tells important?</h4>

We hold two versions of show and tell at VIX Digital. We finish every week with an **internal** show and tell on a Friday and hold **external** ones for clients at the end of a sprint. They both consist of a simple slide show that highlights the important milestones within the week or sprint. 

Our internal show and tells are a way for us to round up the week and for each team member to showcase what they have achieved and propose future development. Each team member gets a 10 minute slot with time for questions at the end. In this time we suggest that you outline what your goal was, what you did to achieve it, what have you learnt and what are the next stages. Show and tell is a great way to inform the group on significant changes or developments made in that week or how they have contributed to the overall goal. 

Our external show and tells are a little more formal. We like to invite the client into the studio or visit them on site to give a presentation on how their product is shaping. This is a key contact point in order for us to receive feedback on the current product. These are important as it allows us to ensure our goals are aligned with the clients and they are happy with the progress. It also allows us to highlight any problems or suggest improvements from what we have discovered. 

Prioritization is key when giving a show and tell. We use them to highlight important findings, changes and development rather than try and include everything.
