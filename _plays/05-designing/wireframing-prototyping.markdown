<h4>Designing to Developing</h4>

The entire team are always involved in each step of the project. In the design process developers are included in the concept phase right through to user testing to ensure they have full understanding of the the user needs and the designs created. User needs have the will dicate to developers on what technologies they are going to use to approach and complete this project. This will have informed the designers descisions such as using foundation framework to create the layout for the design if the front-end developers will be using foundation within the CSS. 

Our designers will create consise wireframes, user flows and provide any collateral and assets required for the project using Sketch or Illustrator. The wire frames don't use colours or images, they simply outline content and space allowing the developers to begin creating the architecture for the project. We often create high and low fidelity wireframes depending on the project detail and timescale. 

- Low fi wireframes contain simple blocks of space and mock content including a navigation bar, logo and footer.
- Hi fi wireframes are an extension of low fi wireframes but allow for more details of each element such as behaviours and dimensions.

Focus is placed on ensuring the developers, front and back, are working in sync and able to use the wireframes as blueprints for the project.

<h4>To minimise hand offs and create a successful project flow, we believe in the following</h4> 

- Act as one team
- Include developers at the start of any project
- Encourage constant communication and open dialogue
- Experiment together
- Prototype and wireframe everything
