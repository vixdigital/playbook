<h4>Four principles to design by</h4>

At VIX we're passionate about building inclusivity and accessibility into the core of our products. Although it can be difficult depending on the nature of the product, we always try our best to design and build application with the 4 main principles of web accessibility in mind:

* Perceivability
* Operability
* Understandability
* Robustness

<h4>Perceivability</h4>

We then need to think about perceivability when designing the UI and the content for our applications. Are users able to see/hear or otherwise perceive the information and media we're trying to show them? This means we need to make sure that for any non-textual content we have a text alternative, that text is large enough to be read and that content has high enough contrast with the user interface so that it doesn't get lost.

Colour blindness (aka colour vision deficiency or CVD) support also falls under this principle. Safe colour design is important in making sure you aren't accidentally making content *invisible* to anyone with one of the various forms of CVD.

<h4>Operability</h4>

Operability considerations begin right at the start of our projects, when we're creating the initial low fidelity wireframes. We try to think about how different people will use the website, keeping in mind that some might be navigating it using only their keyboard because of a physical impairment and others might be consuming it using a screenreader because of a visual impairments/blindness.

<h4>Understandability</h4>

The third principle of understandability deals with making sure that the content that your readers are faced with is understandable. Increasing understandability might be as simple as reducing the amount of complex language and jargon that is used on any given age (by a guide we try to stick to KS2 reading ability). Another way to improve how well people understand your textual content is to back it up with pictures or diagrams. 

Sometimes users simply cannot get to grips with a particular advanced article because they don't know enough about the subject, in which case you should always try to provide references to reading materials that would help them expand their understanding.

Other elements of your web application such as buttons and other interactables should be obvious, and their *function* should be obvious (e.g. instead of "Read more..." you could use "Click here to read more...").

<h4>Robustness</h4>

The final principle is simple about making  your website in such as way that it can be properly consumed by various different types of user agent (browser, screen reader etc). After all, if users can't load your website properly, the rest of the principles aren't going to help them very much.

That being said, we try to do our bit to further modern browser adoption. Old browsers are slow, insecure and stunt the advancement of web technologies and design.
